	Created a test suite for Dezoomify. Currently only some of the most central functionality is tested.

	Extended zoom level options.

	Adjusted logging levels. Verbosity level zero now prints only warnings and errors.

	Added an underscore to batch mode filename numbering.

	Exceptions during processing of an individual image in batch mode are now ignored.

2014-04-10  Martin Valgur  <martin.valgur@gmail.com>

	File URIs used on Windows are now properly supported.

2013-12-27  Martin Valgur  <martin@valgur.ee>

	Fixed bug: downloading progress was not being updated. Joining progressbar crashed, since downloading progressbar was not finished. Fixed bug: Numeric suffix in batch mode contained spaces, not zeros.

2013-12-05  Martin Valgur  <martin@valgur.ee>

	Discarded the old jpegtran untiling algorithm, the new one is the only option now. Rearranged the progressbar-related code to be closer together.

2013-11-26  Lukáš Říha  <cedel@centrum.cz>

	Untiling - jt_xl - empty space instead of broken tile.
	Unusable tile image (that was downloaded but is broken in some way -
	jpegtran cannot process it) now produces an empty space, instead of a
	neigbouring image from a previous iteration beiing used.

	Minor refactoring - more meaningful variable names.

2013-11-25  Lukáš Říha  <cedel@centrum.cz>

	Very minor correction.

	Remove unused variable (merge change from pillow branch)

2013-11-24  Lukáš Říha  <cedel@centrum.cz>

	Added another joining algorithm, switching mechanics + smaller changes.
	* Added faster jpegtran untiling algorithm
	* Added switching mechanism to switch untiling algorithm
	* Added untiler algorithm info to displayed debug info
	* Moved chunk of common progressbar update code to a separate function
	* Added developer to README

	Revert "Added another joining algorithm, switching mechanics + smaller changes."
	This reverts commit c1f055aea8ea7a5dc8993abc0c88c361d82581f0.

2013-11-23  forquest  <cedel@centrum.cz>

	Merge branch 'master' of git://git.code.sf.net/p/dezoomify/code

2013-11-21  Martin Valgur  <martin@valgur.ee>

	Edited usage information to be clearer and more helpful.

2013-11-21  forquest  <cedel@centrum.cz>

	Improve URL list (-l switch) handling - check for and ignore empty lines.

2013-11-21  Martin Valgur  <martin@valgur.ee>

	Use '--help' instead of '--nonsense' as a parameter when checking for the -drop feature of jpegtran.

2013-11-21  forquest  <cedel@centrum.cz>

	Modified the help to be more of use.

	Corrected tab vs. space in description of -l parameter.

2013-11-20  forquest  <cedel@centrum.cz>

	Modify checking for -drop feature of jpegtran, so it won't timeout silently and give a user sensible response.

2013-10-10  Martin Valgur  <martin@valgur.ee>

	Converted variable names from CamelCase to lower_case_with_underscores to conform with PEP8.

	Some overall tidying of the code.

	Fixed tabs-spaces inconsistency in README.

	Adjusted usage instructions.

2013-10-09  Martin Valgur  <martin@valgur.ee>

	Tiny bit more compact code for ZoomifyImagePath searching.

2013-10-08  Martin Valgur  <martin@valgur.ee>

	Dezoomify now checks that the supplied jpegtran has the '-drop' feature.

	Dezoomify now checks that the jpegtran being used has the '-drop' feature.

2013-10-07  Martin Valgur  <martin@valgur.ee>

	More efficient ImageProperties.xml processing.

	Base directory input parameter can now end with 'ImageProperties.xml'. Better HTTP error handling. Misc. small adjustments.

	* Added progressbars to tile downloading & joining via (optional) progressbar module. * Removed the jpeg-8c_patch. The new (2012-10-05) version of jpegtran (that includes the drop patch) has the required functionality now. The jpegtran binaries bundled with dezoomify (for convenience) were replaced with the official ones. * Cleaned up the threaded downloading somewhat. * Fixed temporary directories not always being deleted in case of some exceptions.

2013-02-26  Martin Valgur  <martin@valgur.ee>

	Fixed handling of HTTP errors. Fixed a bug with zoomlevels.

	Stripped some more symbols from the jpegtran.exe executable.

	Modified the zoomlevel calculation code based on a suggestion at https://sourceforge.net/p/dezoomify/discussion/general/thread/784798c8/ .

	Stripped debugging symbols from jpegtran executables.

	Fixed a small bug that slipped in with the last commit. Made jpegtran excecutable detection more robust.

2013-02-25  Martin Valgur  <martin@valgur.ee>

	Reformatted the code a bit with PEP8 in mind.

	All output now uses Python's logging module. Made the command line arguments -i and -o positional.

	Made URL retrieval and file downloading more consistent.

2012-05-26  Martin Valgur  <martin@valgur.ee>

	Removed some not-too-important debugging output.

	Added one more Zoomify base path detection for newer Zoomify versions.

2012-05-24  Martin Valgur  <quibik@gmail.com>

	Fixed a bug of image creation failing when one or more tiles are missing on the server.

2012-03-31  Martin Valgur  <quibik@gmail.com>

	Rebuilt jpegtran.exe statically (no msvcr100.dll dependency anymore). Optimized it slightly by modifying build options.

2012-03-31  Martin Valgur  <kvib@users.sourceforge.net>

	Added additional regex check for HTML5 version of Zoomify.

2012-03-30  Martin Valgur  <kvib@users.sourceforge.net>

	Fixed two bugs: * URLs given via the -i parameter did not work (because of a typo in code). * getUrl() failed to download URLs with spaces in them. Fixed by escaping non-standard characters in the URL.

2012-02-05  Inductiveload  <inductiveload@gmail.com>

	More robust jpegtran location, broke dezoomify-specific code out to a separate class as a prelude to a more modular system

2011-10-17  Inductiveload  <inductiveload@gmail.com>

	Add GUI fiddlings, installation instructions in README

2011-10-07  Martin Valgur  <kvib@users.sourceforge.net>

	Fixed a bug with the -t parameter. Raised the default number of threads to 16.

	Tile downloading and joining are now done simultaneously.

	Unicode decoding errors are now ignored (bulk of the website contents is irrelevant anyway).

2011-10-06  Martin Valgur  <kvib@users.sourceforge.net>

	Added my e-mail address to the contact list.

	Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/master'
	* origin/master:
	  Add README file, with licensing
	  Sensible warning and exit if Python < 3 is used
	  Add icon, and sensible warning if Python <3 is used

2011-10-06  Inductiveload  <inductiveload@gmail.com>

	Add README file, with licensing

2011-10-06  Martin Valgur  <kvib@users.sourceforge.net>

	Fixed a bug in command line parameter handling.

2011-10-06  Inductiveload  <inductiveload@gmail.com>

	Sensible warning and exit if Python < 3 is used

	Add icon, and sensible warning if Python <3 is used

2011-10-06  Martin Valgur  <kvib@users.sourceforge.net>

	Proper Linux build of jpegtran this time (32-bit for wider compatibility).

	Reverted jpegtran to the initial version. The version I commited was just a shell script *facepalm*.

	Converted the line endings in dezoomify.py to Unix style. Changed shebang to point to python3.

	The jpegtran executable is now patched. Included the source code of the patch.

	* Made all path name concatenations use os.path.join(). * Fixed a bug at the JPEG optimization step. Output was directed to stdout, not the JPEG file.

2011-10-04  Inductiveload  <inductiveload@gmail.com>

	Initial commit.
